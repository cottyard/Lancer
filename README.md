Lancer is the same-time chess.

Under browser_prototype/browser, `npm install`, then `npm run build` to compile.

Under browser_prototype/server, `npm install` to install all dependencies. `npm run dev` to start local server. Or `tsc` to compile first and `node build/server/server.js` to start server.
